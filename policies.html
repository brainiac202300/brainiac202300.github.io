            <p>In continuing our promise towards investors in assuring their trading is conducted with confidence
              COIN INVEST GROUP promotes fully transparent trading policy to its stakeholders and investors.
              We give you all the required trading information you need, including good rates, spreads and leverage, and
              other benefits of being an investor under our platform. All provided to ensure a safe and comfortable
              trading experience.</p>
            <p>
              In the simplest form, COIN INVEST GROUP platform is a form of speculative futures trading, whereby the payoff is
              either a pre-agreed amount or nothing at all. This total dual outcome is the reason the term "trading" is
              used. trading Options can be applied to a broad number of assets, including commodities, stocks, indices
              and even currency pairs. The main prerequisite required by these assets is that their values fluctuate
              constantly throughout each trading day. This is important as you never actually buy an asset when you
              purchase a trading option; you are simply making a speculative investment on an assets behavior over a set
              period of time. trading options have gained much popularity in recent years, due to their simple up/down
              nature, the low cost required to participate and the increased return on investment profits (ROI).

            </p>

              <h2>Anti-money Laundering Policy</h2>
            </div>


            <p>COIN INVEST GROUP does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight against money
              launders. COIN INVEST GROUP follows the guidelines set by the Germany’s joint money laundering
              steering group. The Germany’s is a full member of the Financial Action Task Force(FATF), the
              intergovernmental body whose purpose is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
            </p>
            <p>COIN INVEST GROUP now has policies in place to deter people from laundering money.</p>
            <p>These policies include:</p>
            <ol class="custom-ul">
              <li>Ensuring clients have valid proof of identification</li>
              <li>Maintaining records of identification information</li>
              <li>Determining that clients are not known or suspected terrorist by checking their names against list of
                known or suspected terrorist.</li>
              <li>Informing clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity</li>
              <li>Closely following clients’ money transactions</li>
              <li>Not accepting cash, money orders or third party transactions</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial
              system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources.
            </p>
            <p>Money Laundering Usually follows three stages:</p>
            <p>Firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system.</p>
            <p>Secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts, through a series of financial transactions
              designed to obscure the origin of the money.</p>
            <p>And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from
              legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account).
            </p>
            <p>Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of
              the funds. In particular, a trading account can be used to execute financial transactions that help
              obscure the origins of the funds</p>
            <p>Coin Invest direct funds withdrawal back to the original source of remittance, as a
              preventive measure.
            </p>
            <p>International Anti-money Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of potential
              money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance program to
              deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity.</p>
            <p>These guidelines have been implemented to protect Coin Invest and its clients.</p>
            <p>HAPPY INVESTING!!!</p>

            <p>Obviously, like any online transaction, if you are going to put your money somewhere, you need to know
              that it is in safe hands. Any platform where you are financially transacting needs to be licensed and
              regulated for you to be confident that your money is safe. Each country has its own regulator and rules
              surrounding regulation and you should always look for the licensing accreditation when you are selecting
              who to trade with.</p>

            <h2>CFD TRADING</h2>
          </div>
          <p>CFD or contract for difference trading is a form of derivative trading which allows you to trade on global
            markets and predict the rise and fall of those markets. The money is made or lost on the difference in price
            of the asset when the contract is entered and the price when it is exited hence the name Contract for
            Difference.</p>
          <p>CFD trading has become increasingly popular because of the tax benefits but also because it can generate
            high profits. The extensive choice of markets available to trade, make it a good choice. Choose to trade in
            Forex, commodities, stocks and indices.</p>
          <p>As with any form of trading, it is essential to choose your trading company wisely. It is critical to make
            an informed decision based on a number of factors. This is where we come in. We conduct the research, so
            that you don't have to. Once we have tried and tested a market, we bring you a full review of the best that
            the market has to offer, so that you can make the best out of your investment.

          </p>
          <div class="site-heading text-center my-5">
            <h2>HOW DOES CFD TRADING WORK</h2>
          </div>
          <p>CFD or Contract for Difference trading requires you to predict the rise or fall of various market; Forex,
            commodities, stocks and indices. You don't actually purchase the assets, instead you enter a contract
            between you and the broker. Let's say you want to trade on the outcome of the UK FTSE 100 and you expect it
            to rise. You enter the contract at the current price of the FTSE 100 and then when you are ready to exit the
            difference in price (the spread) is what you get paid on.</p>
          <p>You can buy multiple contracts which then multiplies the spread by the number of contracts you buy. This is
            your profit.
          </p>
          <p>In order to maximize you return on Investment (ROI) profit, you need to ensure that you are trading on a
            reliable platform with a good trading company. There is much to consider when choosing a trading
            company/platform.</p>
          <div class="site-heading text-center my-5">
            <h2>DIVERSITY OF MARKETS</h2>
          </div>
          <p>If you look at the number of Forex pairs, commodities, indices and stocks that you could choose to trade in
            there are literally thousands. What you want is the option to choose which of these markets you want to
            trade. Choosing a broker that offers a wide selection means that you have much more choice. Make sure you
            check what is available before you open an account. If you want to trade non fiat currency markets, check
            out cryptocurrency trading.
          </p>
          <div class="site-heading text-center my-5">
            <h2>MOBILE TRADING</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            For many, time is a valuable commodity. No longer do people have the time to be sat In front of a computer
            at a desk all day. They need the flexibility to be able to trade on the move. That is why having a good
            mobile offering is critical.
